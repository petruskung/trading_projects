# trading_projects
These are my projects from Academics or Work. 
I have yet to receive all my previous projects as my old laptop broke down recently, all projects are expected to be uploaded within the next month.
In each code file, I will include sidenotes to aid understanding it.
The files range from portfolio management, to algorithmic trading, to asset pricing.
I have a Financial Engineering background, so these projects are closely related to my academic background and interest in quantitative trading and equity derivatives. 
Hope you enjoy reading my code and no copying please.
