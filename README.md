# trading_projects
These are my projects from Academics or Work. 
In each code file, I will include sidenotes to aid understanding it.
The files range from portfolio management, to algorithmic trading, to asset pricing.
I have a Financial Engineering background, so these projects are closely related to my academic background and interest in quantitative trading and equity derivatives. 
Hope you enjoy reading my code and no copying please.
